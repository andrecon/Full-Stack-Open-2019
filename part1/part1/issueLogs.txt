	Had three vulnerabilities in my dependencies:
		set-value - high severity
		mixin-deep - high severity
		lodash.template - critical severity

	Steps that fixed the issues:
		$ npm install --save mixin-deep
		$ npm i --save lodash.template
		$ npm i --save set-value

	This upgraded dependencies but gave me an issue when running "npm start"
	Issue log:
		`Failed to compile.
		 Cannot find module '/USER_PATH/node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/slicedToArray

	To fix this i did:
		$ npm add @babel/runtime
